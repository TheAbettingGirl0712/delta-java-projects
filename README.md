# Delta Team Project

Welcome to the Delta team's group project! We are a group of young coders eager to learn, collaborate, and improve ourselves as developers. This project documents our journey as we tackle daily challenges, build new skills, and support each other in our growth.

## About Us

We are **Team Delta**—a collective of passionate learners who believe in constant improvement and helping each other grow. Every day, we set coding challenges for ourselves and our teammates, pushing the boundaries of what we know and can achieve.

## Project Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A log of the daily coding challenges we tackle.
- A showcase of our individual and collaborative solutions.
- A reflection on our learning process and progress.
- A space to encourage and support each other as we develop our coding skills.

## Key Features

- **Daily Challenges:** Each member contributes challenges in their field of interest.
- **Collaborative Solutions:** Everyone is encouraged to solve, review, and discuss solutions.
- **Documentation of Growth:** We log our learnings and improvements over time.

## Getting Involved

If you’re interested in learning with us or want to see young coders in action, feel free to browse our challenges, try them out, or even contribute!
